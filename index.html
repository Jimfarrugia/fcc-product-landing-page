      <h2>The Story of Charvel</h2>
      <p>
        The birthplace of many legendary guitarists, Southern California is also
        home to one of the original innovators of high performance
        guitars—Charvel®. Charvel guitars are the very embodiment of
        high-performance tone machines, and discerning players who prize
        superior sound and feel have turned to the company's finely crafted
        guitars as their weapons of choice for more than 30 years. From metal
        masters including Warren DeMartini and Jake E Lee to instrumental fusion
        legends such as Allan Holdsworth and Shawn Lane to modern day virtuosos
        like Guthrie Govan, musicians worldwide have long relied on Charvel for
        exceptional guitar design.
      </p>
      <p>
        High-end "hot-rodded" appointments considered extraordinary on lesser
        instruments are standard features on most Charvel guitars. These include
        compound-radius fingerboards, exceptionally hot pickups designed to send
        amps into screaming overdrive, Floyd Rose® bridge tremolo systems,
        customized electronics, heavy-duty hardware and highly original (even
        outlandish) textural and graphic finishes.

      <p>
        That devotion to tone, performance and innovation and to meeting the
        unique design needs of technically advanced guitarists is nothing new.
        It all dates back to Charvel's original home and formative
        years—Southern California in the late 1970s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charvel shares DNA and deep roots with Jackson guitars, and in the late
        1970s it was Grover Jackson who built the first guitars bearing the
        Charvel name. Jackson had worked at Charvel's Guitar Repair, a small
        shop in Azusa, Calif., that specialized in hot-rodding traditional
        electric guitars, before he bought the company from founder Wayne
        Charvel in late 1978. Jackson quickly began building traditional-style
        electric guitars loaded with high-performance refinements, to which he
        applied the Charvel name. The guitars debuted in summer 1979 and
        steadily gained acclaim, especially among a flashy new early-'80s
        generation of dazzlingly talented Southern California guitarists.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to those fine early Charvel instruments, Grover Jackson soon
        embarked on a second line of guitars bearing his own name. But from
        those late-'70s days onward, Charvel forged its own distinctive identity
        and earned its own sterling reputation for producing
        hot-rodded-yet-classy "muscle car" guitars preferred by many of the
        world's most technically accomplished players, notably in the metal and
        fusion worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
        In each era since its arrival—the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and right on
        through to today—Charvel has offered innovative and original guitar
        models with the very best in high-performance design and features. With
        the modern-era DK24 platform, several new remarkable artist models, and
        the time-honored San Dimas and So-Cal models, Charvel continues to forge
        a very bright high-performance future for guitarists everywhere.
